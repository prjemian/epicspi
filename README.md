Installing EPICS on the Raspberry Pi
========================================

For those who haven't heard, the EPICS software is an open-source 
control system used worldwide for the routine operation and control
of many particle accelerators 
such as FermiLab and SLAC, for the oepration of scientific telescopes such 
as the Gemini and Keck telescopes, X-ray synchrotrons such as the 
Advanced Photon Source and the Diamond Light Source, neutron diffraction
instruments such as the Spallation Neutron Source, and lots of other neat 
stuff.  The system is scalable and runs on lots of different hardware,
now including the **Raspberry Pi!**
