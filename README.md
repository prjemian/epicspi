Installing EPICS on the Raspberry Pi
========================================

For those who haven't heard, EPICS (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics) is an 
open-source control system used worldwide for the routine operation and 
control of many particle accelerators such as FermiLab and SLAC, for the 
operation of scientific telescopes such as the Gemini and Keck 
telescopes, X-ray synchrotrons such as the Advanced Photon Source and the 
Diamond Light Source, neutron diffraction facilities such as the 
Spallation Neutron Source, and lots of other neat stuff.  The system is 
scalable and runs on lots of different hardware.  Here, we show you
how to run EPICS on the **Raspberry Pi!**
